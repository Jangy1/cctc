Hierarchical Toplogy
The hierarchical topology model is made up of the following:
A core layer - high-end switches optimized for network availability and performance.
A distribution layer - switches implementing forwarding decisions.
An access layer - connecting users via hubs, bridges, or switches.

(ARP) is a networking protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC address within a local network segment.

-Shutdown unused ports-
interface fastethernet 0/1
shutdown

-Switchport Port Security- Can be used to limit the number of MAC addresses that can be dynamically learned on a port or static MAC addresses can be assigned to one. Violation modes of shut down can be used to secure the port should a violation occur.
