C:\demo>bcdedit /export C:\Lion\BCD
C:\demo>bcdedit /import C:\Lion\BCD

-Persistence through a service-
Get-CimInstance -classname win32_service | select displayname

cat suspicious files

bcdedit /deletevalue {value} valuename

-Verify mbr locating boot signature-
sudo xxd -1 512 -g 1 /dev/sda

/boot/grub/x86_64-efi/normal.mod + /boot/grub/grub.cfg

lsmod = List loaded kernel modules

cat /etc/inittab = init reads to select default run levels
/etc/rc#.d = Contains scripts to start/stop daemons
top = show PID and all services correlating

greb -aob "GRUB" mbroken = Sorts binary and locates where the string is at
dd if=mbroken bs=1 skip=446 count=16 2>/dev/nll
cat .boot/grub/grub.cfg = GRUB configuration

-ALWAYS CHECK PROFILES-
$PROFILE = Command configs and environmental variables dedicated to certain user, filepaths and scripts included
AllUsersAllHosts
